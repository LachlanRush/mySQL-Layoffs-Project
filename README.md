# mySQL Layoffs Project
A mySQL project to clean and analyze layoff data, showcasing my skills in database management and SQL querying.

## Overview
I built this project to process layoff data through data cleaning and analysis, using mySQL to handle duplicates, standardize data, and extract trends.

## Files
- `layoffs_cleaning.sql`: Removes duplicates, standardizes data, and handles nulls.
- `layoffs_analysis.sql`: Analyzes layoffs by company, industry, and time.

## Key Skills
- Cleaning: Deduplicated and standardized data with CTEs and joins.
- Analysis: Aggregated data and calculated rolling totals with window functions.
- mySQL: Designed schemas and wrote efficient queries.
